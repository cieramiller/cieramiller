  <p id="setting"> <b>INT. WALKER BUILDING - NIGHT </b> </p>
  <p id="action">CIERA sits in class and writes notes. She has no experience coding. She doesn't know exactly where to start her notes. But she does.</p>
  <p>
  <p id="character"> <b>CIERA</b></p>
  <p id="parenthetical"><i> (taking notes)</i> </p>
<p id="dialogue">
CSS - looks uniform across the HTML <br>
Uses selectors (tags, < i >,< /i >) and declarations (how to look: color, font, etc) <br>
How things are presented/formatted on a website <br>
  Swirly swirl = CSS
 <br> </p>
  <p id="action"> ALYN takes the class to CodePen and shows them how to use. ALYN sends the students off to try it out. CIERA gets distracted for moment and misses ALYN's instructions. </p>
  <p id="character"> <b> CIERA </b> </p> 
  <p id="parenthetical"><i> (panicking)</i> </p>
  <p id="dialogue"> Oh no, I stopped paying attention for five seconds and missed their instructions. Play it cool, dude, play it cool. </p>
  <p id="action"> CIERA plays around on the page. She looks up how to change the font. It excites her to find that she can change them, but she wishes the "fantasy" font wasn't papyrus. ALYN gives the class five more minutes before moving onto the table.</p>
  <p id="character"> <b> CIERA </b> </p> 
  <p id="parenthetical"> <i> (glancing at her neighbor's screen) </i> </p>
  <p id="dialogue"> What she's doing is so much cooler than what I'm doing. I should think of something better. </p>
    <p id="action"> While CIERA thinks, ALYN instructs the class to stop so they can show the class how to make a table. CIERA, again, is only half-paying attention. </p>
  <p id="character"> <b> CIERA </b> </p> 
  <p id="parenthetical"> <i> (to herself) </i>
  <p id="dialogue"> I wonder if I could rearrange this to look like a screenplay...
  </p>
  <p id="action"> CIERA tunes back into ALYN to learn how to change the table around. When ALYN finishes, CIERA does not immediately work on the table. Instead, she rearranges her scattered lines of text into something she's more proud of. She wishes the dialogue HTMLs could be in block text to more closely resemble a screenplay, but that is probably a whole other lesson.
  <p id="character"> <b> ALYN </b> </p>
  <p id="dialogue"> Did I hear someone say this is fun? What are you enjoying? </p>
  <p id= "character"> <b> KYRA </b> </p>
  <p id="parenthetical"> <i> (laughing) </i> </p>
  <p id="dialogue"> I'm just putting different kinds of potatoes in the table.
    <p id="action"> A few chuckles erupt from around the room. CIERA remembers that KYRA is from Idaho and has talked about how potatoes are the first thing people bring up when they talk to her. CIERA starts to work on her own table. </p>
  <p id="character"> <b> CIERA </b> </p>

  <p id="dialogue"> Alright everyone, I just want to go over the homework before we all leave. </p>
  <p id="action"> CIERA hasn't finished her table but she looks up as ALYN explains the homework is to create a resume using CodePen and shows the class how to arrange the document into sections. </p>
  <p id="character"> <b> ALYN </b> </p>
  <p id="dialogue"> Oh, and to download what you've been working on today, click "Share" in the bottom right corner. Do you all see it? </p>
  <p id="action"> CIERA nods and assumes others do as well. They all begin to shut their computers to head out for the night, and CIERA does the same. She wishes she could finish it all tonight, but she does have to work in the morning and should head home for sleep. She gathers her things and leaves.
